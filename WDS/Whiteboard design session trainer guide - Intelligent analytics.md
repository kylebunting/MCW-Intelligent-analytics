## Trainer information

Thank you for taking time to support the whiteboard design sessions as a trainer!

### Role of the trainer

An amazing trainer:

* Creates a safe environment in which learning can take place.
* Stimulates the participant's thinking.
* Involves the participant in the learning process.
* Manages the learning process (on time, on topic, and adjusting to benefit participants).
* Ensures individual participant accountability.
* Ties it all together for the participant.
* Provides insight and experience to the learning process.
* Effectively leads the whiteboard design session discussion.
* Monitors quality and appropriateness of participant deliverables.
* Effectively leads the feedback process.

### Whiteboard design session flow

Each whiteboard design session uses the following flow:

#### Step 1: Review the customer case study (15 minutes)

**Outcome**: Analyze your customer's needs

* Customer's background, situation, needs and technical requirements
* Current customer infrastructure and architecture
* Potential issues, objectives and blockers

#### Step 2: Design a proof of concept solution (60 minutes)

**Outcome**: Prepare to present a solution for your target customer audience

* Determine your target customer audience
* Determine customer's business needs to address your solution
* Design and diagram your solution
* Prepare to present your solution

#### Step 3: Present the solution (30 minutes)

**Outcome**: Present solution to your customer

* Present solution
* Respond to customer objections
* Receive feedback

#### Wrap-up (15 minutes)

* Review preferred solution

### Before the whiteboard design session: How to prepare

Before conducting your first whiteboard design session:

* Read the Student guide (including the case study) and Trainer guide
* Become familiar with all key points and activities.
* Plan the point you want to stress, which questions you want to drive, transitions, and be ready to answer questions.
* Prior to the whiteboard design session, discuss the case study to pick up more ideas.
* Make notes for later.

### During the whiteboard design session: Tips for an effective whiteboard design session

**Refer to the Trainer guide** to stay on track and observe the timings.

**Do not expect to memorize every detail** of the whiteboard design session.

When participants are doing activities, you can **look ahead to refresh your memory**.

* **Adjust activity and whiteboard design session pace** as needed to allow time for presenting, feedback, and sharing.
* **Add examples, points, and stories** from your own experience. Think about stories you can share that help you make your points clearly and effectively.
* **Consider creating a "parking lot"** to record issues or questions raised that are outside the scope of the whiteboard design session or can be answered later. Decide how you will address these issues, so you can acknowledge them without being derailed by them.

**Have fun**! Encourage participants to have fun and share!

**Involve your participants.** Talk and share your knowledge but always involve your participants, even while you are the one speaking.

**Ask questions** and get them to share to fully involve your group in the learning process.

**Ask first**, whenever possible. Before launching into a topic, learn your audience's opinions about it and experiences with it. Asking first enables you to assess their level of knowledge and experience, and leaves them more open to what you are presenting.

**Wait for responses**. If you ask a question such as, "What's your experience with (fill in the blank)?" then wait. Do not be afraid of a little silence. If you leap into the silence, your participants will feel you are not serious about involving them and will become passive. Give participants a chance to think, and if no one answers, patiently ask again. You will usually get a response.

## Intelligent analytics whiteboard design session student guide

### Abstract

In this whiteboard design session, you will learn about real-time analytics without IoT. You will design a solution to enable intelligent conversation in a machine learning-enabled, real-time chat pipeline to allow hotel guests to chat with one another, and to communicate directly with the concierge. You will also apply analytics to visualize customer sentiment in real-time.

After completing the whiteboard design session, you will be better able to design a lambda architecture, and have a better understanding of how to enable web-based real-time messaging thru Web Sockets, Event Hubs, and Services Bus.

### Step 1: Review the customer case study

**Outcome**: Analyze your customer’s needs.

**Time frame**: 15 minutes

**Directions**: With all participants in the session, the facilitator/SME presents an overview of the customer case study along with technical tips.

1. Meet your table participants and trainer
2. Read all of the directions for steps 1–3 in the student guide
3. As a table team, review the following customer case study

#### Customer situation

Adventure Works travel specializes in building software solutions for the hospitality industry. They are designing their latest product, an enterprise grade, social chat app called Concierge+. The mobile friendly web app is intended to enable guests to easily stay in touch with the concierge and other guests, enabling greater personalization and improving their experience during their stay.

The original requirements for the product were to support:

* One-on-one chat sessions between a hotel guest and a hotel concierge
* A public chat room for hotel guests and hotel staff, called the Hotel Lobby
* Full-text message search, including via #hashtags and @usernames
* **Email or SMS messages to guests informing them their housekeeping or room service request has been received, and the estimated time of delivery**

Adventure Works wants to build a solution that is both scalable and extensible. According to Marc Tripp, the CTO of Adventure Works: "We want it scalable in the sense that it could support the chat requirements of the largest hotels in the world, currently with as many as 7,200 rooms. While we don't anticipate having any single chat room with a thousand guests or 2,000 concurrent one-on-one chats between a guest and the concierge staff, we want a solution that could handle that if needed."

Extensible in the sense that they can add new features on top of the solid, baseline real-time messaging functionality. For example, while they are starting by supporting search (for their backend) across chat messages, they already have a set of extensions they know they want to perform.

An important extensibility point for them is a way for them to gather the sentiment of their guests as they interact in the public chat rooms and with the concierge. Hotel operators are motivated to keep tabs on guest sentiment in real-time, so they can respond to any upset guests quickly and turn a miserable stay into an amazing stay. To this end, they would like a dashboard (that updates in real-time) showing the volume of chat messages flowing thru their system, a pie chart showing the most active users at a glance, a bar chart highlighting upset users (who need to be addressed ASAP), and some form of gauge showing the average real-time sentiment for window of time (e.g., the last hour, last 24 hours).

While guest sentiment is important, it is a reactive measure. Adventure Works would like to take a proactive approach in positively affecting sentiment by expediting the requests of their guests via chat. In particular, they are looking to experiment with automating the routing of routine guest requests (e.g., "Can I get more towels?", "I forgot my toothbrush" and "Can I get a bottle of champagne") that would otherwise require the attention of an already overloaded front desk attendant. These requests, once automatically routed, could be sent directly to housekeeping or room service as is most appropriate. Adventure Works has heard of active machine learning, whereby the system improves constantly with use, while still knowing what it is unsure of and asking for help when it determines it needs assistance.

**Additionally, they are interested in a providing a service that automates the sending of email or SMS messages to hotel guests who have submitted a housekeeping or room service request, informing them that their request has been received, and what time they can expect the request to be delivered to their room.**

Finally, to help them reflect on chats that occur in public chat rooms, they would like to log the messages to a durable store and make them full text searchable. In the future, they are thinking of using this same approach to enable Twitter-like search for @entities and #labels.

#### Customer needs

1. Adventure Works would like their Concierge+ service to avoid using any servers or VMs that they would have to maintain.
2. Their real-time chat solution needs to be scalable to support their largest hotel customers.
3. The chat solution needs to be extensible and provide support for sentiment analysis and contextual understanding.
4. The public chat history needs to be fully searchable.
5. The dashboard they use to visualize sentiment needs to update in real time.

#### Customer objections

1. It is not clear if we should be using the Bot Framework for our request forwarding or something else?
2. We do not want to build our own machine learning models in order to detect the sentiment of chat in real time.
3. Can we really build a real-time, intelligent chat solution entirely in Azure?

##### Infographic of common scenarios

![Screenshot of a sample Internet of Things workflow, which is broken into On-Premises and Azure services.](./media/common-scenarios.png "Common Internet of Things scenarios")

### Step 2: Design a proof of concept solution

## Intelligent analytics whiteboard design session trainer guide

### Step 1: Review the customer case study

* Check in with your table participants to introduce yourself as the trainer.
* Ask, "What questions do you have about the customer case study?"
* Briefly review the steps and timeframes of the whiteboard design session.
* Ready, set, go! Let the table participants begin.

### Step 2: Design a proof of concept solution

* Check in with your tables to ensure that they are transitioning from step to step on time.
* Provide some feedback on their responses to the business needs and design.
  * Try asking questions first that will lead the participants to discover the answers on their own.
* Provide feedback for their responses to the customer's objections.
  * Try asking questions first that will lead the participants to discover the answers on their own.

### Step 3: Present the solution

* Determine which table will be paired with your table before Step 3 begins.
* For the first round, assign one table as the Microsoft team and the other table as the customer.
* Have the Microsoft team present their solution to the customer team.
  * Have the customer team provide one objection for the Microsoft team to respond to.
  * The presentation and objections should be no longer than 10 minutes.
* Have participants on the customer team give feedback to the Microsoft team.
  * The feedback should be no longer than 5 minutes.
  * If needed, the trainer may also provide feedback.

### Wrap-up

* Have the table participants reconvene with the larger session group to hear a SME share the following preferred solution.

### Preferred target audience

* Marc Tripp, the CTO of Adventure Works
* The primary audience is the business decision makers and technology decision makers. From the case study scenario, it would include the Director of Analytics. Usually we talk to the infrastructure managers who report to the chief information officers (CIOs), or to application sponsors, such as a line of business (LOB) vice president (VP), chief marketing officer (CMO), or to those who represent the business unit IT or developers who report to application sponsors.

### Preferred solution

#### High-level architecture

1. Without getting into the details (the following sections will address the particular details), diagram your initial vision for handling the top-level requirements for handling the baseline chat, sentiment analysis and request forwarding.

    ![Preferred solution high-level architecture. Shows data flowing in from user devices, like mobile phones and laptops, to an Azure Web App. Those messages are sent to Event Hub, which are then processed by a Web Job running an Event Processor Host. This is responsible for executing Azure Cognitive Services for sentiment analysis and language understanding. Data is sent to Service Bus and another Event Hub for processing.](media/preferred-solution-architecture.png "Preferred solution architecture")

    *Messages are sent from browsers running within laptop or mobile clients via Web Sockets to an endpoint running in an Azure Web App. Instead of typing a chat message, end users can leverage the speech to text functionality of the Speech API to type the chat message for them* in this scenario the Speech API is invoked directly from the web page running in a client device. Chat messages received by the Web App are sent to an Event Hub where they are temporarily stored. A Web Job picks up the chat messages and applies sentiment analysis to the message text (using the Text Analytics API), as well as contextual understanding (using LUIS). The Web Job forwards the chat message to an Event Hub used to store messages for archival purposes, and to a Service Bus Topic which is used to deliver the message to the intended recipients. A Stream Analytics Job provides a simple mechanism for pulling the chat messages from the second Event Hub and writing them both to CosmosDB for archival and to PowerBI for visualization of sentiment in real-time. An indexer runs atop CosmosDB that updates the Azure Search index which provides full text search capability. Messages in the Service Bus Topic are pulled by Subscriptions created in the Web App and running on behalf of each client device connected by Web Sockets. When the Subscription receives a message, it is pushed via Web Sockets down to the browser-based app and displayed in a web page.*

    > NOTE: The preferred solution is only one of many possible, viable approaches.

#### Baseline chat

1. How would you recommend that Adventure Works receive messages from mobile and desktop browsers?

    *The flow of chat messages from a mobile browser or desktop browser begins with the mobile browser making a Web Sockets connection to a Web App, over which the web app can receive sent messages and push received messages.*

2. How would you store ingested messages? Would you use Event Hubs or Service Bus? Be specific on your reasoning and how you would configure it.

    *The Web App acts like a proxy both for receiving messages from the devices and forwarding them on to an Event Hub, which is where messages are temporarily stored until they can processed and forwarded on. The choice to always send chat messages through Event Hub was made to satisfy the extensibility and scalability requirements. By using Event Hub, the ingest of chat messages can scale to tremendous volumes, whilst also allowing new downstream consumer applications to be added as needed, without concern for Service Bus Topic and Subscription limits (e.g., number of concurrent connections/subscriptions and throughput) when performing internal message routing.*

3. How would you forward messages to the intermediate storage from which the recipients will receive them? Would you use Stream Analytics or Web Jobs?

    *Web Jobs running Event Processor Host are used to pull chat messages from Event Hubs to forward messages to the appropriate Service Bus Topics from which chat participants receive their messages. The Web Job is responsible for forwarding the message (which consists of both custom message properties and a JSON payload body) from the Event Hub to a Service Bus Topic. The reason EventProcessorHost was used here, and not Stream Analytics is that currently Stream Analytics does not process nor forward along message properties---it only works against the message body. The ability to handle message properties is critical to this solution.*

4. What queued storage would you use for the recipients and why? Be specific on your reasoning and how you would configure it.

    *Service Bus Topics would be used to store the messages while they await the recipient(s) to retrieve them. See the answer to the next question for the details.*

5. Given your choice of intermediate storage, how would you implement a public chat room? How would you implement one on one chat?

    *The main concept that enable the bi-directional chat is the definition of a chat session. A chat session can be one-to-one (such as the concierge and hotel guest) or many-to-many (such as the hotel lobby chat room). In Service Bus, the minimal configuration of this maps to each session consisting of two or more Subscriptions against one Topic for the whole hotel:*

    *A one-on-one chat consists of two Subscriptions (one for each user in the chat), each subscription with a SQL Filter where the filter examines the message property "SessionID".*

    *A public chat is many Subscriptions (one for each user in the chat) with a SQL Filter with a SQL Filter where the filter examines the message property "SessionID".*

    *In either case, the "connection" is made when messages are sent that have the same value for the SessionID property because the message will be picked up by the Subscriptions that are listening for messages with that SessionID and ultimately delivered to related client.*

    ![The Chat request diagram begins with the Devices that are sending chat requests to the concierge, using Web Sockets (Message send). The chat request then flow through Web App (Messaging Endpoint), then on to a Service Bus (Topic & Subscriptions), where they are distributed to the Concierges\' devices that are receiving the chat requests.](./media/preferred-solution-chat-request.png "Chat request diagram")

    *The one-on-one session (and its corresponding session ID) are established dynamically. The guest to concierge pattern is a lot like it works with the telephone---a guest dials the concierge, a bank of phones ring at the concierge desk and one of them is answered by a concierge. In this case, the hotel guest uses the web app to send a message to a subscription that is listening for messages with a particular username (e.g., "concierge"). Each instance of the concierge app, which is a console client, is effectively a competing consumer against that subscription, and only one of the concierge apps will take the message and join a chat session with the user. This chat request message contains the Session ID that the concierge app should join to in order to speak "privately" with the guest, which the concierge app automatically does following the pattern previously described for the chat message flow. The key distinction is that the Session ID to which the chat client creates Service Bus Subscriptions in this case are dynamically created.*

#### Sentiment analysis

1. What service would you recommend Adventure Works capitalize on in order to scalably apply a sentiment score to each message as it enters the system?

    *The Text Analytics API, part of Microsoft Cognitive Services.*

2. How would you enhance your baseline chat flow to incorporate this sentiment processing?

    *Web Jobs are used to pull chat messages from Event Hubs, invoke the Text Analytics API to apply sentiment scores to each message and to forward messages (now including a sentiment score) to Service Bus Topics from which chat participants receive their messages.*

#### Request forwarding

1. What Azure service or API would you suggest Adventure Works utilize for understanding how to route guest requests to housekeeping or room service?

    *The Language Understanding Intelligent Service (LUIS) API, which is a part of Microsoft Cognitive Services would enable Adventure Works to define contextual models that can identify intents (e.g., what the chat user is wanting to do) and entities (e.g., the subject of their action).*

2. How would you implement or configure this service?

    *Contoso would need to provision a Cognitive Services account with the API type of LUIS using the Azure Portal and copy the Key from the Manage Keys blade. Then they can use the website at [https://www.luis.ai/](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/) to create a new app. Once they have created an empty new app, that should update the App Settings with the key they acquired from the Azure Portal. They use the LUIS website to define their intents and entities. In their case, they might define two intents: one for ordering room service for the delivery of food, and another intent for the requesting the delivery of room items. They then would define the entities, food items like pizza, pasta or wine and room items like toothpaste or pillows. They can improve LUIS's model by providing utterances that are examples tagged with desired intent and entities. Once ready, they can publish the model at which point it can be accessed using a GET request to the provided endpoint, where the request to process is passed in via the q querystring parameter (e.g., [https://api.projectoxford.ai/luis/v1/application?id=e49d5497&subscription-key=617800&q=send%20some%20pizza)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/service-bus-quotas/?id=e49d5497&subscription-key=617800&q=send%20some%20pizza)).*

3. How would you integrate this service into your chat message processing flow?

    *The Event Processor logic should be extended to support the processing of requests. As messages are scored for sentiment, they can also be sent to the LUIS web service endpoint. The JSON response that LUIS provides will indicate if the message matches one of the configured intents or no intent. If it matches an intent, then Event Processor logic could forward the message on to the Service Bus Topic appropriate for room service or housekeeping, from which they could then respond to the guest as appropriate. If it does not match an intent, the message would be forwarded on to the intended Topic with the expectation that hotel staff would respond to it.*

##### SMS messaging

1. **What Azure service would you recommend Adventure Works use for sending email or SMS messages to guests requesting housekeeping or room services via chat?**

    _**Logic App could be used to send email or SMS messages to guests who request either housekeeping or room service requests via the chat application, while also meeting the Adventure Works' desire to use a serverless architecture in Azure. They could use a Twilio connector to send SMS messages to the guest's phone number on file, or an email could be sent if no phone number is available.**_

2. **How could you integrate this service into your chat message processing flow?**

    _**If the LUIS API determines the request should be forwarded to either housekeeping or room service, then Event Processor logic could forward the message on to the Service Bus Topic appropriate for room service or housekeeping. From there, the Logic App could be triggered to send an email or SMS message to the guest as appropriate using the Service Bus connector for Logic App.**_

#### Message search

1. What Azure services would you use to durably store the messages and enable them for full text search? How would you extend your messaging pipeline so that all messages get archived after they have been tagged with sentiment?

    *In order to support the requirements of searchable messaging and long-term extensibility, all chat messages flow thru Event Hubs (which gives the solution the ability to "plug in" new forms of downstream message processing) and are stored in CosmosDB. To support the searching of messages, an Azure Search Index is created that is updated every five minutes by an Azure Search Indexer that pulls new message entries from CosmosDB. Once a message is indexed within Azure Search, it properties (such as the username of the user who sent) and its message body become full-text searchable. To perform a search, the browser which loads the search web page on the device makes a cross-origin, XmlHttpRequest to an API App that wraps requests to the Azure Search API, as illustrated by the following diagram:*

    > TODO: Update preferred solution to include Logic App

    ![This is the Preferred solution for Message Fowarding, sending chat messages through Event Hubs. Search implemented through Azure Search. As described in the previous text. Devices (performing searches) on the left feed into API App (Search API) via \#Seattle. API App (via \#Seattle) then flows into an Azure cloud labeled Search (match text) which then flows back to API App with a collection of message documents with hit highlighting.](./media/preferred-solution-message-forwarding.png "Azure Services flowchart")

    *The messages matching the search are returned, with HTML and CSS formatting embedded so that the particular text that matches the search query is emphasized upon results display.*

#### Visualization and reporting

1. What tool would you recommend Adventure Works utilize for constructing their real-time sentiment dashboard?

    *To build a dashboard that updates with sentiments statistics in real-time, Adventure Works could use Power BI. Note that they would have to use PowerBI.com to build these dashboards, as currently real-time dashboards cannot be built using Power BI Desktop.*

2. How would you build this dashboard using the tool you recommended?

    *To build a real-time dashboard in PowerBI, one needs to create a dashboard populated with visuals created using PowerBI QA. Adventure Works would need to create a report (using any visualization) on data coming into the dataset from the Stream Analytics Job. This static report is used to select a visualization, such as the Gauge visualization that can then be pinned to a new dashboard. After opening the new dashboard, real-time dashboards are created in Power BI using the QA feature, by typing in a question to visualize in the space provided. In the "Ask a question about your data", they would enter a question that would drive the visualization, such as: "average score created between yesterday and today." They can set the visualization to use to display the result and then pin the visual to dashboard. This new visual will update in real-time as data is inserted into the underlying dataset.*

    ![The Power BI dashboard has four panes: two Count of Messages panes, an Average Sentiment, and Upset Users. The first Count of Messages pane displays a number (18).

### Checklist of preferred objection handling

1. It is not clear if we should be using the Bot Framework for our request forwarding or something else?

    *The Bot Framework is intended for building chat bots that integrate with existing services such as text/sms, Skype, Slack, and Office 365---on its own it does not provide a chat messaging framework. In Adventure Works' case, they are looking for an in-house chat solution, so the Bot framework would not be an appropriate solution, albeit they could integrate their own bots using the Directline API, a REST API provided by the Bot framework that, among other things, enables the sending of messages to a Bot and retrieving the response.*

2. We do not want to build our own machine learning models in order to detect the sentiment of chat in real time.

    *By using the Text Analytics API, Adventure Works is able to leverage a field tested, performant text sentiment model that requires only invocation by web service call.*

3. Can we really build a real-time, intelligent chat solution entirely in Azure?

    *Yes!*

### Customer quote (to be read back to the attendees at the end)

"What's cooler than sentiment analytics on real-time chat? Azure, because it enables us to give hotel operators back the connection they lost as their hotel sizes increased."
