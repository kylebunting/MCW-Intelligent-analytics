## Abstract

In this whiteboard design session, you will learn about real-time analytics without IoT. You will design a solution to enable intelligent conversation in a machine learning-enabled, real-time chat pipeline to allow hotel guests to chat with one another, and to communicate directly with the concierge. You will also apply analytics to visualize customer sentiment in real-time.

After completing the whiteboard design session, you will be better able to design a lambda architecture, and have a better understanding of how to enable web-based real-time messaging thru Web Sockets, Event Hubs, and Services Bus.

## Step 1: Review the customer case study

**Outcome**: Analyze your customer’s needs.

**Time frame**: 15 minutes

**Directions**: With all participants in the session, the facilitator/SME presents an overview of the customer case study along with technical tips.

1. Meet your table participants and trainer
2. Read all of the directions for steps 1–3 in the student guide
3. As a table team, review the following customer case study

### Customer situation

Adventure Works travel specializes in building software solutions for the hospitality industry. They are designing their latest product, an enterprise grade, social chat app called Concierge+. The mobile friendly web app is intended to enable guests to easily stay in touch with the concierge and other guests, enabling greater personalization and improving their experience during their stay.

The original requirements for the product were to support:

* One-on-one chat sessions between a hotel guest and a hotel concierge
* A public chat room for hotel guests and hotel staff, called the Hotel Lobby
* Full-text message search, including via \#hashtags and \@usernames

Adventure Works wants to build a solution that is both scalable and extensible. According to Marc Tripp, the CTO of Adventure Works: "We want it scalable in the sense that it could support the chat requirements of the largest hotels in the world, currently with as many as 7,200 rooms. While we don't anticipate having any single chat room with a thousand guests or 2,000 concurrent one-on-one chats between a guest and the concierge staff, we want a solution that could handle that if it needed to."

Extensible in the sense that they can add new features on top of the solid, baseline real-time messaging functionality. For example, while they are starting by supporting search (for their backend) across chat messages, they already have a set of extensions they know they want to perform.

An important extensibility point for them is a way for them to gather the sentiment of their guests as they interact in the public chat rooms and with the concierge. Hotel operators are motivated to keep tabs on guest sentiment in real-time, so they can respond to any upset guests quickly and turn a miserable stay into an amazing stay. To this end, they would like a dashboard (that updates in real-time) showing the volume of chat messages flowing thru their system, a pie chart showing the most active users at a glance, a bar chart highlighting upset users (who need to be addressed ASAP), and some form of gauge showing the average real-time sentiment for window of time (e.g., the last hour, last 24 hours).

While guest sentiment is important, it is a reactive measure. Adventure Works would like to take a proactive approach in positively affecting sentiment by expediting the requests of their guests via chat. In particular, they are looking to experiment with automating the routing of routine guest requests (e.g., "Can I get more towels?", "I forgot my toothbrush" and "Can I get a bottle of champagne") that would otherwise require the attention of an already overloaded front desk attendant. These requests, once automatically routed, could be sent directly to housekeeping or room service as is most appropriate. Adventure Works has heard of active machine learning\-* whereby the system improves constantly with use, while still knowing what it is unsure of and asking for help when it determines it needs assistance.

Finally, to help them reflect on chats that occur in public chat rooms, they would like to log the messages to a durable store and make them full text searchable. In the future, they are thinking of using this same approach to enable Twitter-like search for @entities and #labels.

### Customer needs

1. Adventure Works would like their Concierge+ service to avoid using any servers or VMs that they would have to maintain.
2. Their real-time chat solution needs to be scalable to support their largest hotel customers.
3. The chat solution needs to be extensible and provide support for sentiment analysis and contextual understanding.
4. The public chat history needs to be fully searchable.
5. The dashboard they use to visualize sentiment needs to update in real time.

### Customer objections

1. It is not clear if we should be using the Bot Framework for our request forwarding or something else?
2. We do not want to build our own machine learning models in order to detect the sentiment of chat in real time.
3. Can we really build a real-time, intelligent chat solution entirely in Azure?

## Step 2: Design a proof of concept solution

**Outcome**: Design a solution and prepare to present the solution to the target customer audience in a 15-minute chalk-talk format.

Time frame: 60 minutes

### Business needs

**Directions**: With all participants at your table, answer the following questions and list the answers on a flip chart.

1. Who should you present this solution to? Who is your target customer audience? Who are the decision makers?
2. What customer business needs do you need to address with your solution?

### Design

**Directions**: With all participants at your table, respond to the following questions on a flip chart.

#### High-level architecture

1. Without getting into the details (the following sections will address the particular details), diagram your initial vision for handling the top-level requirements for supporting the baseline chat, sentiment analysis, and request forwarding.

#### Baseline chat

1. How would you recommend that Adventure Works receive message from mobile and desktop browsers?
2. How would you store ingested messages? Would you use Event Hubs or Service Bus? Be specific on your reasoning and how you would configure it.
3. How would you forward messages to the intermediate storage from which the recipients will receive them? Would you use Stream Analytics or Web Jobs?
4. What queued storage would you use for the recipients and why? Be specific on your reasoning and how you would configure it.
5. Given your choice of intermediate storage, how would you implement a public chat room? How would you implement one on one chat?

#### Sentiment analysis

1. What service would you recommend Adventure Works capitalize on in order to scalably apply a sentiment score to each message as it enters the system?
2. How would you enhance your baseline chat flow to incorporate this sentiment processing?

#### Request forwarding

1. What Azure service or API would you suggest Adventure Works utilize for understanding how to route guest requests to housekeeping or room service?
2. How would you implement or configure this service?
3. How would you integrate this service into your chat message processing flow?

#### Message search

1. What Azure services would you use to durably store the messages and enable them for full text search? How would you extend your messaging pipeline so that all messages get archived after they have been tagged with sentiment?

#### Visualization and reporting

1. What tool would you recommend Adventure Works utilize for constructing their real-time sentiment dashboard?
2. How would you build this dashboard using the tool you recommended?

### Prepare

**Directions**: With all participants at your table:

1. Identify any customer needs that are not addressed with the proposed solution.
2. Identify the benefits of your solution.
3. Determine how you will respond to the customer’s objections.
4. Prepare a 15-minute chalk-talk style presentation to the customer.

## Step 3: Present the solution

**Outcome**: Present a solution to the target customer audience in a 15-minute chalk-talk format.

**Time frame**: 30 minutes

### Presentation

**Directions**:

1. Pair with another table.
2. One table is the Microsoft team and the other table is the customer.
3. The Microsoft team presents their proposed solution to the customer.
4. The customer makes one of the objections from the list of objections.
5. The Microsoft team responds to the objection.
6. The customer team gives feedback to the Microsoft team.
7. Tables switch roles and repeat Steps 2–6.

## Wrap-up

**Timeframe**: 15 minutes

Tables reconvene with the larger group to hear a SME share the preferred solution for the case study.
